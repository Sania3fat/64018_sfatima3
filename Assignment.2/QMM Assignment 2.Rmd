LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODEL:

	Objective Function:  

Our goal is to maximize (Smax) the overall profit:

Smax = 420pA1+420pA2+420pA3+360pB1+ 360pB2+ 360pB3+ 300pC1+ 300pC2+300pC3 respectively.

	 Constraints:
EXCESS CAPACITY:
Excess capacity for Plant 1: pA1 + pB1 + pC1 <= 750
Excess capacity for Plant 2: pA2 + pB2 + pC2 <= 900
Excess capacity for Plant 3: pA3 + pB3 + pC3 <= 450

RESTRICTION ON SALE PREDICTIONS:
Large sales prediction: pA1 + pB2 + pC3 < = 900
Medium sales prediction: pA1 + pB2 + pC3 <= 1200
Small sales prediction: pA1 + pB2 + pC3 <= 750 

STORAGE VOLUME:
Storage volume in plant 1: 20pA1+15pB1+12pC1 <= 13000
Storage area in plant 2: 20pA2 + 15pB2 + 12pC2 <= 12000.
Storage space in plant 3: 20pA3 + 15pB3 + 12pC3 <= 5000.

Given that each plant should consume an equal percentage of its production unit.
  900(pA1+ pB1+ pC1) – 750(pA2+ pB2+ pC2) = 0
	450(pA2+ pB2+ pC2) – 900(pA3+ pB3+ pC3) = 0
	450(pA1+pB1+pC1) – 750 (pA3+pB3+pC3)=0

NON-NEGATIVITY:
      pA1, pA2, pA3, pB1, pB2, pB3, pC1, pC2, pC3 >= 0:( non-Negativity)
